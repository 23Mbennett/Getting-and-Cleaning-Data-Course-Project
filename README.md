# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## About the Raw Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.
In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## About the Script
The following is a summary description of the project instructions that were developed into run_analysis script:
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
The end result is shown in the file TidyDataSet.txt.
